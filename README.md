Project Personal Library

1) ADD YOUR MongoDB connection string to .env without quotes as db
    `example: DB=mongodb://admin:pass@1234.mlab.com:1234/fccpersonallib`
2) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes
3) You need to create all routes within `routes/api.js`
4) You will add any security features to `server.js`
5) You will create all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`


Nothing from my website will be cached in my client as a security measure.
I will see that the site is powered by 'PHP 4.2.0' even though it isn't as a security measure.

<b>I can post a title to /api/books to add a book and returned will be the object with the title and a unique _id.
I can get /api/books to retrieve an aray of all books containing title, _id, & commentcount.
I can get /api/books/{_id} to retrieve a single object of a book containing title, _id, & an array of comments (empty array if no comments present).</b>

<b>I can post a comment to /api/books/{_id} to add a comment to a book and returned will be the books object similar to get /api/books/{_id}.</b>

<b>I can delete /api/books/{_id} to delete a book from the collection. Returned will be 'delete successful' if successful.</b>
<b>If I try to request a book that doesn't exist I will get a 'no book exists' message.</b>

<b>I can send a delete request to /api/books to delete all books in the database.</b> Returned will be 'complete delete successful' if successful.


All 6 functional tests required are complete and passing.
